Norm Wheeler had never
been in a pawn shop before, much less the back office. As the humorless attendant led him behind the counter and down the hallway, Norm imagined it would look like the office behind any other small shop---a ceiling fan, a few filing cabinets, a window shaded by stained blinds, a desk strewn with papers and maybe an ashtray. But the tiny office in the back of Billy Dough's Pawn Shop was even more stuffed with junk than the main showroom. In one corner an energy saver bulb flickered in a shadeless lamp. In another corner was a display case filled with dozens of what looked like marbles, each on its own pedestal. Against the wall, a wobbly stack of ripped cardboard boxes threatened to spill a dozen rolls of paper towels onto the floor. There were no windows. If there were filing cabinets, Norm could not see them. There was no ceiling fan. The only ventilation was a small fan mounted through the back wall near the ceiling.

The one thing Norm got right was the ashtray, made of blue-tinted glass with a logo printed in dark blue on one ridge. Seven or eight slender, half-smoked cigarettes lay crumpled in the ashtray and on the blotter it rested on. The desk was small, old, made of dark wood. One deep drawer was open.

The attendant closed the door behind Norm.

Behind the desk, in the only chair in the room, sat a small, pleasant-looking man with an obvious toupee. That would be Emile Bilodeau, pawn broker, loan shark, bookie. And probably a few other professions of the kind that did not confer letters to print after your name on your business card.

Norm noticed that one lens of his glasses was smudged. He wanted to wipe it, but did not have a tissue or cloth to wipe it with. There were Bilodeau's paper towels, but paper towels only smeared smudges.

Bilodeau jabbed his jaw at Norm. "How can I help you, Mister Wheeler?" He took a slow drag on his cigarette, then blew the smoke out to one side.

Norm glanced up at the fan. The blade was not turning. Four wedges of mid-afternoon sunlight shone through the fan only to be diffused through pillows of blue smoke suspended in the still air.

Norm coughed. There was no easy way into this conversation. So say it plain. "I want you to kill Paulo Lencioni. And I'll pay you."

Bilodeau scratched his ear and winced. "What on earth gives you the impression that I would even entertain such a proposition?"

"I just thought--- I mean I guess because---" Because Bilodeau was a known criminal.

"Because he's the competition?"

"Yes, something like that." Bilodeau had killed Armitage, after all. Or had him killed. Everybody knew that. Everybody except the jury.

"Murdering the competition is just a figure of speech, Mister Wheeler."

"But surely you'd like Lencioni gone."

"Well, yes, but I'm happy to do that in the marketplace. I'm not in the murder business. I merely take bets." Bilodeau spread his hands, the look on his face inviting Norm to contradict him if he dared.

"But don't you sometimes..." Norm did not dare.

"Don't I sometimes what?"

"Don't you, if a client doesn't pay..."

"Don't we kill clients who don't pay?"

Norm nodded. He noticed that Bilodeau had said "we."

"Good Lord, no," Bilodeau said. "What business are you in, Mister Wheeler?"

"I'm an accountant." For the moment.

"Did they teach you at accounting school to kill clients who don't pay?"

"No, sir."

"Because it seems to me, with only my high school education to guide me, that killing clients is bad business practice." Bilodeau drew thoughtfully on his cigarette, then crushed it, half-smoked, in the ashtray. "First off, dead clients don't pay, and it's not as if we can take their heirs to court. Second, killing our customers would surely discourage others from doing business with us. Do you see?"

"Yes, of course. But if they don't pay..."

"Then we encourage them to pay."

"Don't you sometimes, to encourage, sometimes... their family or something?"

"Murder our clients' loved ones?"

"I thought---"

"You watch too many bad movies, Mister Wheeler. Are accountants as boring in real life as they appear on television?"

Some of us, yes. At least in our professional lives. "I suppose it's a mix of personalities, like every profession."

"Where do you work?"

Norm did not want to disclose any more personal information. But this intimate little dance seemed to be part of Bilodeau's price. In for a penny... "At Indigo."

Bilodeau threw his head back and laughed. "You're an accountant at the racetrack?"

"Yes."

"And I take it you're in deep debt to Lencioni?"

Norm nodded.

"Don't tell me you bet on the ponies."

"I'd rather not discuss the nature of my business with Lencioni." The money Norm owed was only half of his trouble. The other half was that Lencioni was running out of patience, and had threatened to expose Norm to his employers at Indigo. The other half was that if Norm's employers learned of any reason to suspect his integrity, they'd quickly discover that he had none, that he'd been siphoning money off the books for more than a year.

Three halves. One half too many.
